    <h1>Hi, I'm Raeanna Warren </h1> 
    <p> I am a 20-year-old Computer Science major at UWI.I chose to take INF03180 because I have a strong passion for web development and its impact on the tech industry. 
I am committed to excelling in this course and am confident that I will achieve an A+.
A bit about me—I am a dedicated and ambitious student, sometimes to the point of being an overachiever, which can be overwhelming at times.
I enjoy listening to music and spending quality time with my loved ones. I also have a love for flowers, especially peonies, which are my favorite.
Currently, I hold the position of Academic Chairperson on the Computing Subcommittee. I love being a leader and find fulfillment in guiding and inspiring others.
To me, leadership is about fostering collaboration, uplifting those around me, and setting a positive example.
A strong leader not only provides direction but also listens, encourages, and helps others grow.
In my role, I strive to embody these qualities and make a meaningful impact.
